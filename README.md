### Repository

**MAIN Branch**  
The Main Branch is the landing page when this repository is opened. As this is the ontl brach present in this repository. All the application files as well as the README and Documentation files are in this branch. By doing this we will know where to find spesific files. We find the following files:

 The workflow file can be located here as well as the report for the application. There are 3 workflow files.

 ### My Tamagotchi Pet the App  
 
As stated previously Android Studio was used to construct the entire application and was also treated in the way of using the emulator to insure the main featsures work on the application. My Tamagotchi Pet Application was developed to replicate the 1996 Tamagotchi Egg toy that was first released in Bandai in Japan on 23 November 1996 (Andersen, 2021). This little toy had a 32x16 pixel screen where the little digital pet could be seen on, as well as 3 little buttons to be used to take care of the pet (Andersen, 2021). Just like the toy egg, this application was developed to be used by children but itâ€™s not limited as the public can also use it.

This app uses features like buttons and input features that make it really user friendly so the user knows what to do and where the information will appear. Also taking to heart of the application into consideration... THE CODE! Using Kotlin as the language of choice, in the code all the information is stored and therefore it is the key to making this application work to put it lightly, but this is just brief and the full is in the report.

### GitHub Actions

Although this application mauanlly is fully capeable to display error messages when an certain criteria are not met testing is a great way to show that the applications is in full running condition. GitHub Actions is a fast and effective way to do so, with creating workflows it runs all the tests when any new code is pushed to GitHub automatically.

Now although I personally think GitHub Actions is an effective tool, for this assignment however I couldn't fully make use of it.
**The Generated APK AAB 2 Bundle Tool was could not build completely.**

Back to the matter at hand GitHub Actions, insures there are no bugs. Mine has one named:  
```Generated APK AAB 2 Bundle Tool workflow - Error: Process completed with exit code 1.```

### The App Report 

The application report will comprehensively explain the:  
    a.Purpose of the App  
    b.Design Considerations
       -Intuitive design   
       -Content prioritisation  
       -Legible Text Content  
       -Make Interface Element Clearly visible.  
       -Hand Position Controls  
       -Emulator Example:  
    c.Utilisation of GitHub & GitHub Actions  
       -GitHub Actions  
    d.YouTube Ling  
    e.References  

The report can be located in the MAIN Branch > Application Documentation
